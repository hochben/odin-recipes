    <p>
      If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place.<br>
      Because we are too â€” especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.<br>
          Place shreds in bowl and mix the onion, flour and egg until evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
          When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer.<br>
          Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make seperate piles like pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>Cook until nicely browned on the botttom, then flip over and brown on the other side.<br>
          It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
